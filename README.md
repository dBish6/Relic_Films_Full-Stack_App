# Relic_Films_Full-Stack_App
This is a older application that was used as practice for my very last final sprint at Keyin College; [located here](https://github.com/dBish6/Full-Stack_SpringAPI_Sprint2_Final). This application taught me so many things before my final, this was my first time calling APIs in React, so this taught me how to fetch data in React and just React fundamentals because this is when I was first really getting into React. Like Hooks, routing, States, useEffect, useRef, folder stucture and so on. I thank this application for the knownlege it gave me to build bigger and better applications.

### Running the Server

- Change the postgres.db.config.js to your credentials located in back-end/model.
- Use the backup to import the data or use the .csv file provided, the SQL for creating the tables/views is all there, located in back-end/model.
- npm run server

### Running the React App

- npm start

<i>And don't forget to do npm install in both the front-end and back-end folders.<i>
